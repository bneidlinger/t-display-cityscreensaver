Night imagery:

Add dithering (fake glow) by randomly brightening neighboring pixels a tiny amount.

Two-layer grid: roads layer + ambient glow layer (blur-ish).

Water/parks mask: generate a few big dark blobs that roads avoid (looks like lakes/green space).

Arterials vs streets: 10% of walkers deposit stronger brightness and turn less often (highways).
